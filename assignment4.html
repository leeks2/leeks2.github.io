            <h1>Sydney's Assignment 4 - Libraries!</h1>
            <p>
            For this assignment, I used the IR sensor and remote to change the behavior of a servo (on/off, rotation direction, and rotation speed).
            </p>

            <p>
            For the voltage divider, I created a circuit from power through a 10KΩ resistor and photoresistor to ground, with an analogRead at pin A0 in between the resistors.
            <br>
            For each LED, I created a circuit from analog pins 9-10 through 220Ω resistors, green and yellow LEDs, and to ground.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="Assignment3/schematic.jpg" width=400></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            A schematic of the circuit is shown above. <br> <br>
            The voltage divider allows you to calculate how a variable resistor is changing based on variable voltage readings from between the resistors. <br>
            For R1, I chose to use 10KΩ. There isn't a specific required resistance to use, but based on measurements I took the photoresistor varied between 150-6000Ω.
            10KΩ is a good value to use because it isn't overly larger or smaller than the photoresistor's range, 
            and R1 will have more precise variation with R1+R2 in the following calculation.    
            <p>
              <b> V-out = V-in * R2/(R1+R2)</b><br>
              You can solve for R2 (our variable resistor) using <b> R2 = (V-out * R1)/(V-in - V-out)</b> where V-in is always 5V, 
              V-out is our reading (converted from 0-1023 to 0-5), and R1 is 10KΩ.
            <br><br>
            For the LEDs, I chose to use 220Ω resistors to keep the current below the 20 mA (.02A) limit of the LEDs. 
            The pins send out 5V, and the yellow and green LEDs cause a 1.8V drop. I calculated the resistance to use based on Ohm's law (V = I*R).
            </p>
            <b> (5 - 1.8)V = .02A * [x]Ω</b> <br>
            <b> 3.2V / .02A = [x]Ω </b> <br>
            <b> x = 160</b>
            <p>
            The calculated resistance is 160Ω. I chose to use 220Ω, because it was the next highest value of the resistors I had, and a higher resistance would put the current a little bit lower than the limit.
            </p>

            My code uses the Servo and IRremote libraries. For the IRremote, I have code to read in the various remote input commands. 
            Calibration of these commands comes from converting them to a more understandable string name to use later. I then use the commands
            to update booleans and integers related to the Servo behavior. I also print the commands and values to the
            serial monitor to keep track of what the sensor is reading.
            <br><br>
            For the Servo, I have the angle of the servo update with the write command so it can half-rotate (0-180 degrees). 
            These commands change from on/off, and change their direction and speed depending on what the IR remote commands were.
