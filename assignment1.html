            <h1>Sydney's Assignment 1 - Blink!</h1>
            <p>
            For this assignment, I created a circuit of 3 LEDs which blink in sequence and then together in a pattern.

            <p>
            I created circuits starting from pins 11-13, going through 220Ω resistors and red and yellow LEDs, and going to ground.

            <p>
            A schematic of the circuit is shown above. I chose to use 220Ω resistors to keep the current below the 20 mA (.02A) limit of the LEDs. 
            The pins send out 5V when on HIGH, and the red and yellow LEDs cause a 1.8V drop. I calculated the resistance to used based on Ohm's law (V = I*R).
            </p>
            <b> (5 - 1.8)V = .02A * [x]Ω</b>
            <b> 3.2V / .02A = [x]Ω </b>
            <b> x = 160</b>
            <p>
            The calculated resistance is 160Ω. I chose to use 220Ω, because it was the next highest value of the resistors I had, and a higher resistance would put the current a little bit lower than the limit.
