            <h1>Sydney's Assignment 3 - Input Output!</h1>
            <p>
            For this assignment, I used input given to a photoresistor in a voltage divider to change 2 LED brightness levels.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
            For the voltage divider, I created a circuit from power through a 10KΩ resistor and photoresistor to ground, with an analogRead at pin A0 in between the resistors.
            <br>
            For each LED, I created a circuit from analog pins 9-10 through 220Ω resistors, green and yellow LEDs, and to ground.

            </p>
            <p>
            A schematic of the circuit is shown above. <br> <br>
            The voltage divider allows you to calculate how a variable resistor is changing based on variable voltage readings from between the resistors. <br>
            For R1, I chose to use 10KΩ. There isn't a specific required resistance to use, but based on measurements I took the photoresistor varied between 150-6000Ω.
            10KΩ is a good value to use because it isn't overly larger or smaller than the photoresistor's range, 
            and R1 will have more precise variation with R1+R2 in the following calculation.    
            <p>
              <b> V-out = V-in * R2/(R1+R2)</b><br>
              You can solve for R2 (our variable resistor) using <b> R2 = (V-out * R1)/(V-in - V-out)</b> where V-in is always 5V, 
              V-out is our reading (converted from 0-1023 to 0-5), and R1 is 10KΩ.
            <br><br>
            For the LEDs, I chose to use 220Ω resistors to keep the current below the 20 mA (.02A) limit of the LEDs. 
            The pins send out 5V, and the yellow and green LEDs cause a 1.8V drop. I calculated the resistance to use based on Ohm's law (V = I*R).
            </p>
            <b> (5 - 1.8)V = .02A * [x]Ω</b> <br>
            <b> 3.2V / .02A = [x]Ω </b> <br>
            <b> x = 160</b>
            <p>
            The calculated resistance is 160Ω. I chose to use 220Ω, because it was the next highest value of the resistors I had, and a higher resistance would put the current a little bit lower than the limit.
            </p>

            </h1>
            During the initial setup, my code calculates min and max readings for 5 seconds to set up a good range of values. Then, during the code loop
            I calculate and constrain my analogRead values between min-max. I use this value to calculate and print the
            resistance of R1 (the photoresistor) to the serial monitor along with the analogRead number, as well as map this value from 0-255 
            to use with analogWrite and the LEDs. I wanted the two LEDs to flip between bright/dark, so I mapped one from 0-255 and the other from 255-0.
            <br><br>
            The values I read from analogRead are between 0-1023, which correspond to voltage levels (0-5V). I used the analogRead value to map to 0-255 for analogWrite and the LEDs,
            and also to calculate and print out the resistance (the analogWrite value converted to 0-5V = V-in).
                <br><br>
<code> <pre>
// this code builds on the analogRead serial example
//It changes 2 LED brightness levels based on readings from a voltage divider connected to a photoresistor

//max and min to calibrate voltage divider
int max = 0;
int min = 1023;

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  // set up pins 9 and 10 as OUTPUT for LEDs
  pinMode(9, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(10, OUTPUT);
  // initialize serial communication at 9600 bits per second:
  Serial.begin(9600);

  //setup min/max values for the voltage resistor
  for (int i = 0; i < 500; i++){
    //get sensor value
    int sensorValue = analogRead(A0);
    //reset min if sensor is low
    if (sensorValue < min){
      min = sensorValue;
    }
    //reset max if sensor is high
    else if (sensorValue > max){
      max = sensorValue;
    }
    //delay 10 * 500 millisecond (5 seconds total to set up)
    delay(10);
  }
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {

  // get voltage divider reading constrained between min-max
  int reading = constrain(analogRead(A0), min, max);
  // print analogRead voltage reading
  Serial.print("Analog read-in = ");
  Serial.println(reading);

  //calculate and print variable resistance of the photoresistor
  // convert reading to 0-5 volt
  double volt = reading * 5.0/1023.0;
  Serial.print("Photoresistor resistance = ");
  // use R2 = (V-out * R1)/(V-in - V-out) to calculate
  Serial.println((volt * 10000.0)/(5.0 - volt));

  //map reading to LED brightness

  //for LED at 9, make it brighter when reading is higher (when resistance is decreasing due to brightness)
  // map from 0-255
  int ledLevel1 = map(reading, min, max, 0 , 255);
  analogWrite(9, ledLevel1);
  //for LED at 10, make it brighter when reading is lower (when resistance is increasing due to dimness)
  // map from 255-0 (opposite previous light mapping)
  int ledLevel2 = map(reading, min, max, 255, 0);
  analogWrite(10, ledLevel2);
