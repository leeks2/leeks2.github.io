            <h1>Sydney's Assignment 2 - Fade (Stoplight)!</h1>
            <p>
            For this assignment, I created a circuit of a red, yellow and green LED each blinking in a unique pattern. The user can switch which light is on by pressing a button.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
            For the LEDs, I created circuits starting from analog pins 9-11, going through 220Ω resistors, red, yellow and green LEDs, and going to ground.
            <br>
            For the button, I created a circuit starting from the 5V pin, going through the button, and going to pin 5 as OUTPUT and a 10kΩ resistor to ground.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
            A schematic of the circuit is shown above. <br>
            For the button, I chose to use a 10kΩ resistor to ensure that current has a path to ground after the button switch is opened. There isn't a specific caluclation or amount of resistance needed, but a high resistance simply helps create a path for current.
            If the circuit doesn't have a resistor between the OUTPUT pin and ground after it's disconnected from power, the electrons won't dissipate automatically and could cause weird readings at the OUTPUT pin.
            <br>
            For the LEDs, I chose to use 220Ω resistors to keep the current below the 20 mA (.02A) limit of the LEDs. 
            The pins send out 5V when on HIGH, and the red, yellow and green LEDs cause a 1.8V drop. I calculated the resistance to use based on Ohm's law (V = I*R).
            </p>
            <b> (5 - 1.8)V = .02A * [x]Ω</b> <br>
            <b> 3.2V / .02A = [x]Ω </b> <br>
            <b> x = 160</b>
            <p>
            The calculated resistance is 160Ω. I chose to use 220Ω, because it was the next highest value of the resistors I had, and a higher resistance would put the current a little bit lower than the limit.
            </p>
            <p>
            My code has two sections; one for reading states from the button to switch between LEDs, and the other for giving each LED unique blinking/fading behavior. <br>
                For the button, I used <code> digitalRead(button) </code>, a while loop, and state-tracking variables to switch between states 1, 2 and 3 when the button is pressed. <br>
                For the LEDs (red = state 1, yellow = state 2, green = state 3), I used <code>analogWrite()</code> for red and yellow, and <code>digitalWrite()</code> for green.
                I made the red LED blink between a brighter and dimmer state, the yellow LED fade between bright and dim, and the green LED simply turn on/off. The <br>
                Another coding challenge I has was not being able to press the button while the light behavior loops were running. 
                To address this, I divided up the behavior of the red and yellow lights into <b>for loops</b>, where an <code>if</code> statement could check if the button was pressed while the loop was running.
                This allowed me to be able to press the button and change the light state even if the light behavior was in the middle of running.
